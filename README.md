# SafePregnancy : 
A streamlit web application for early prediction of gestational diabetes in expectant women.
Application link: [SafePregnancy](https://watch-sugar-mommy.herokuapp.com/) 

## Summary:
The aim of this project is to build a web application that expectant women can use to predict/monitor the risk for gestational diabetes much before their Oral Glucose Tolerance Test is due(around week 26-28).Early prediction would enable early lifestyle interventions which essentially translates to an estimated saving of $3800 per pregnancy.
